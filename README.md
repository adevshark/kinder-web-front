## Used [google-map-react library](https://github.com/google-map-react/google-map-react) &middot; [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/google-map-react/google-map-react-examples.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/google-map-react/google-map-react-examples)

## Stack

- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react) rendering
- [React-router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) for routing
- [Styled components](https://www.styled-components.com/) for styling our components

## Getting started

### Installation

Although I prefer yarn, you can use either yarn or npm:

- `npm install` or simply `yarn`

### Run development

- `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.<br>
You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.

### Run production build

- `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
By default, it also [includes a service worker](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#making-a-progressive-web-app) so that your app loads from local cache on future visits.

Your app is ready to be deployed.

### Deploy to GH pages

- `npm run deploy` or `yarn deploy`

This will push a branch named `gh-pages` to the repository, which will be used by GH to render the latest version of our site.
